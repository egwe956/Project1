**_WELCOME TO KIDS PONG_**

#Section 1 - The Why - my gripes with the original pong game

- because the colours were in just black and white, it can be hard to tell which paddle you are operating
- The AI on the opponent paddle in the original game can be too strong for a kid to play.
- The original game did not have music.
- I wanted to know how to create logic for a frontend application and this project has helped me understand that.

#Section 2 - The How - How I went about doing the project
I am familiar with small game projects on Unity, so I decided to try and use a 2d context canvas to create my game.
I also chose this as I disliked the approach of using CSS to create a display GUI.

#Section 3 - Problems Encountered

I initially had issues getting the ball to accelerate every time the ball touches the paddle.

The other issue I had was also to get sound into the game.

#Section 4 - How to score, and easter eggs

For the red paddle:

1. Get as many paddle hits as you can.
2. Brown ball scores 5 points and moves faster every time you hit it.
3. Orange ball scores 1 point but does not accelerate at all.
4. Use mouse to control red paddle, and keyboard left and right arrow keys to control blue paddle.
   For the blue paddle:
5. Get as many paddle hits as you can.
   1a. The blue paddle will count its score regardless of whether the blue paddle strikes the ball.
   1b However, the blue paddle has a handicap, it will only earn 4 points for the brown ball, and 1 point for the orange ball.
6. Brown ball scores 4 points and moves faster every time you hit it.
7. Orange ball scores 1 point but does not accelerate at all.
8. Use mouse to control red paddle, and keyboard left and right arrow keys to control blue paddle.

   #Section 5 - Known Bugs

The orange ball does not get destroyed when it falls below the red paddle
